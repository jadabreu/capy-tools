Required Permissions Explained:
• host_permissions (amazon.com): Required to access forecast data from Amazon Seller Central
• activeTab: Required to interact with forecast graphs - only activated when you click "Extract Data" on an Amazon page
• downloads: Required to save the extracted data as CSV

All permissions are used solely for data extraction functionality. The extension:
• Only activates on Amazon Seller Central when you explicitly request it
• Uses activeTab instead of broader permissions for better security
• Does not run in the background or on other sites
• Does not collect any personal data
• Does not send data to external servers
• Processes all data locally in your browser
